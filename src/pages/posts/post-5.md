## What is posting in astro?

We know that server side rendering tend to be faster than client side, especially because of the javascript runtime 
that often need a lot of time to load. But, we also know that client side rendering is more flexible and can be used
interactively by the user. So, what if we can combine both of them? That's what astro do.
